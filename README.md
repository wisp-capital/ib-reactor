# ib-reactor

Copy of the repo below
https://github.com/reactor/ib-client

Much credit to sergluka

With modifications to support additional features and remove ones I don't use.

Used to build a jar for ibkr interaction

Include in gradle build:

```
implementation("com.github.wisp-capital:ib_reactor:1.0.5")
```

(only works with auth)
